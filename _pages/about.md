I am an assistant research professor (postdoc) at the Center for Data Science for Enterprise and Society (CDSES) at Cornell University.
My hosts are Professor [Andrea Lodi](https://tech.cornell.edu/people/andrea-lodi/) and Professor [Soroosh Shafiee](https://sorooshafiee.github.io/).

Prior to joining Cornell, I completed my Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Duke University in 2024, advised by Professor [Cynthia Rudin](https://users.cs.duke.edu/~cynthia/).
I also worked closely with Professor [Margo Seltzer](https://www.seltzer.com/margo/).
Before Duke, I earned my B.S. degree with double majors in physics and mathematics and a minor in computer science from University of Michigan, Ann Arbor in 2018. Go Blue!
Here is a [link to my CV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1apcXJB1xHcAuCrFvkBwUTjU37w9sWuhc/view?usp=share_link).

<!-- My main research interest is in interpretable machine learning. My goal is to create simple and sparse models that can fit into the palm of a person's hand but still give accurate predictions. Simple models help us reveal the underyling data pattern and allow people with less technical background to engage in the data science process by bringing with their domain knowledge.-->

My research focuses on *building interpretable, trustworthy, and human-centered ML/AI systems* for high-stakes applications such as healthcare and scientific discovery.
To achieve this, I develop *efficient and scalable optimization algorithms* that solve the challenging nonconvex and combinatorial problems at the *intersection of discrete and continuous optimization*.
My work is organized around three key areas:

1. **Interpretable Model Creation:** Creating highly accurate medical scoring systems and survival models that are simple enough to fit on an index card, enabling transparent and reliable decision-making;

2. **Provably Optimal & Scalable Solvers:** Designing first-order, GPU-accelerated methods for *extreme sparse learning* that facilitate robust scientific discovery in fields such as nonlinear dynamical systems;

3. **Human-Centered AI:** Building interactive systems that leverage the *Rashomon Effect* — the existence of many good models — to facilitate seamless collaboration between domain experts and AI.
