I am Jiachang Liu, a Ph.D. candidate studying machine learning at Duke University. My advisor is Professor [Cynthia Rudin](https://users.cs.duke.edu/~cynthia/). My main research interest is in interpretable machine learning. I am designing ML algorithms that rely heavily on efficient discrete and continuous optimization techniques.

Before coming to Duke, I earned my B.S. degree with double majors in in physics and mathematics and a minor in computer science from University of Michigan, Ann Arbor in 2018.
