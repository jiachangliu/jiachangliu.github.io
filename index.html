While branch-and-bound (BnB) frameworks can certify optimality by pruning nodes using dual bounds, existing methods for computing these bounds are either computationally intensive or exhibit slow convergence, limiting their scalability to large-scale problems. To address this challenge, we propose a first-order proximal gradient algorithm designed to solve the perspective relaxation of the problem within a BnB framework. Specifically, we formulate the relaxed problem as a composite optimization problem and demonstrate that the proximal operator of the non-smooth component can be computed exactly in log-linear time complexity, eliminating the need to solve a computationally expensive second-order cone program. Furthermore, we introduce a simple restart strategy that enhances convergence speed while maintaining low per-iteration complexity. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that our approach significantly accelerates dual bound computations and is highly effective in providing optimality certificates for large-scale problems.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge rounded w-100">NeurIPS</abbr> </div> <div id="liu2024fastsurvival" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">FastSurvival: Hidden Computational Blessings in Training Cox Proportional Hazards Models</div> <div class="author"> <em>Jiachang Liu</em>, Rui Zhang, and Cynthia Rudin </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS)</em>, 2024 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19081" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">PDF</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Survival analysis is an important research topic with applications in healthcare, business, and manufacturing. One essential tool in this area is the Cox proportional hazards (CPH) model, which is widely used for its interpretability, flexibility, and predictive performance. However, for modern data science challenges such as high dimensionality (both n and p) and high feature correlations, current algorithms to train the CPH model have drawbacks, preventing us from using the CPH model at its full potential. The root cause is that the current algorithms, based on the Newton method, have trouble converging due to vanishing second order derivatives when outside the local region of the minimizer. To circumvent this problem, we propose new optimization methods by constructing and minimizing surrogate functions that exploit hidden mathematical structures of the CPH model. Our new methods are easy to implement and ensure monotonic loss decrease and global convergence. Empirically, we verify the computational efficiency of our methods. As a direct application, we show how our optimization methods can be used to solve the cardinality-constrained CPH problem, producing very sparse high-quality models that were not previously practical to construct. We list several extensions that our breakthrough enables, including optimization opportunities, theoretical questions on CPH’s mathematical structure, as well as other CPH-related applications.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge rounded w-100">ICML</abbr> </div> <div id="RudinEtAlAmazing2024" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Position: Amazing Things Come From Having Many Good Models</div> <div class="author"> Cynthia Rudin, Chudi Zhong<sup>*</sup>, Lesia Semenova<sup>*</sup>, Margo Seltzer<sup>*</sup>, Ronald Parr<sup>*</sup>, <em>Jiachang Liu<sup>*</sup></em>, Srikar Katta<sup>*</sup>, Jon Donnelly<sup>*</sup>, Harry Chen<sup>*</sup>, and Zachery Boner<sup>*</sup> </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Proceedings of the International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML), Spotlight</em>, 2024 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://proceedings.mlr.press/v235/rudin24a.html" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">PDF</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>The \textitRashomon Effect, coined by Leo Breiman, describes the phenomenon that there exist many equally good predictive models for the same dataset.

We present algorithms to efficiently and accurately approximate the Rashomon set of sparse, generalized additive models with ellipsoids for fixed support sets and use these ellipsoids to approximate Rashomon sets for many different support sets. The approximated Rashomon set serves as a cornerstone to solve practical challenges such as (1) studying the variable importance for the model class; (2) finding models under user-specified constraints (monotonicity, direct editing); and (3) investigating sudden changes in the shape functions.

Risk scores are sparse linear models with integer coefficients; often these models can be memorized or placed on an index card. Typically, risk scores have been created either without data or by rounding logistic regression coefficients, but these methods do not reliably produce high-quality risk scores. Recent work used mathematical programming, which is computationally slow. We introduce an approach for efficiently producing a collection of high-quality risk scores learned from data. Specifically, our approach produces a pool of almost-optimal sparse continuous solutions, each with a different support set, using a beam-search algorithm. Each of these continuous solutions is transformed into a separate risk score through a "star ray" search, where a range of multipliers are considered before rounding the coefficients sequentially to maintain low logistic loss. Our algorithm returns all of these high-quality risk scores for the user to consider.

As an alternative to the logistic loss, we propose the exponential loss, which permits an analytical solution to the line search at each iteration.

Despite its success, we found that the empirical results of GPT-3 depend heavily on the choice of in-context examples. In this work, we investigate whether there are more effective strategies for judiciously selecting in-context examples (relative to random sampling) that better leverage GPT-3’s few-shot capabilities. Inspired by the recent success of leveraging a retrieval module to augment large-scale neural network models, we propose to retrieve examples that are semantically-similar to a test sample to formulate its corresponding prompt. Intuitively, the in-context examples selected with such a strategy may serve as more informative inputs to unleash GPT-3’s extensive knowledge. We evaluate the proposed approach on several natural language understanding and generation benchmarks, where the retrieval-based prompt selection approach consistently outperforms the random baseline. Moreover, it is observed that the sentence encoders fine-tuned on task-related datasets yield even more helpful retrieval results. Notably, significant gains are observed on tasks such as table-to-text generation (41.9% on the ToTTo dataset) and open-domain question answering (45.5% on the NQ dataset). We hope our investigation could help understand the behaviors of GPT-3 and large-scale pre-trained LMs in general and enhance their few-shot capabilities.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge rounded w-100">TPAMI</abbr> </div> <div id="xu2022representing" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Representing Graphs via Gromov-Wasserstein Factorization</div> <div class="author"> Hongteng Xu, <em>Jiachang Liu</em>, Dixin Luo, and Lawrence Carin </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence</em>, 2022 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9720092" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">PDF</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>We propose a new nonlinear factorization model for graphs that have topological structures, and optionally, node attributes. This model is based on a pseudo-metric called Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) discrepancy, which compares graphs in a relational way. It estimates observed graphs as the GW barycenters constructed by a set of graph bases with different weights. By minimizing the difference between each observed graph and its GW barycenter-based estimation, we learn the graph bases and their weights associated with the observed graphs. The model achieves a novel and flexible factorization mechanism for graphs, in which both the observed graphs and the learnable graph bases can be unaligned and with different sizes. We design an effective approximate algorithm for learning this Gromov-Wasserstein factorization (GWF) model, unrolling loopy computations as stacked modules and computing gradients with backpropagation. For each observed graph, the weights lead to its permutation-invariant representation. These weights can be parametrized by a graph neural network so that we can extend the proposed transductive GWF model to an inductive version. Compared with state-of-the-art methods, our GWF method can represent graphs with better interpretability and using lower dimensionality, while simultaneously achieving encouraging results in graph clustering and classification task.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge rounded w-100">ICML</abbr> </div> <div id="cheng2020club" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">CLUB: A Contrastive Log-ratio Upper Bound of Mutual Information</div> <div class="author"> Pengyu Cheng, Weituo Hao, Shuyang Dai, <em>Jiachang Liu</em>, Zhe Gan, and Lawrence Carin </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>In International Conference on Machine Learning</em>, 2020 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v119/cheng20b/cheng20b.pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">PDF</a> <a href="https://github.com/Linear95/CLUB" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Code</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Mutual information (MI) minimization has gained considerable interests in various machine learning tasks. However, estimating and minimizing MI in high-dimensional spaces remains a challenging problem, especially when only samples, rather than distribution forms, are accessible. Previous works mainly focus on MI lower bound approximation, which is not applicable to MI minimization problems. In this paper, we propose a novel Contrastive Log-ratio Upper Bound (CLUB) of mutual information. We provide a theoretical analysis of the properties of CLUB and its variational approximation. Based on this upper bound, we introduce a MI minimization training scheme and further accelerate it with a negative sampling strategy. Simulation studies on Gaussian distributions show the reliable estimation ability of CLUB. Real-world MI minimization experiments, including domain adaptation and information bottleneck, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
